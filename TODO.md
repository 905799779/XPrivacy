To do
=====

For interested developers:

* [Open issues](https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy/issues?state=open)

* Option to reset user selected dangerous methods
* Document XPrivacy navigation (menu's, presses, long presses) on GitHub
* Better *sh* and *su* command detection
* Accessibility: *android:labelFor="..."*
* Hook location intents
* Hook more package manager methods (which return info about one package)
* Document no usage data, no on demand restricting (after merged revised read me)
